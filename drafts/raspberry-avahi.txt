Tutorial Avahi

Introduction:
    Avahi is the name of the open source version of the Apple Bonjour package which
implement the zeroconf, a set of tools created by Apple enginers to create zero
configuration networks. Zeroconf is implemented in the major OS and in some embedded
systems like Conki, and Windows 8 Embedded, but neither Avahi (for Linux and Unix) and
Bonjour (for Windows and Apple) is standard on Linux or Windows, only Apple has Zeroconf
as a standard package. This guide will help you to achieve Zeroconf in all Major OS, if
you have a Apple Computer you already have Bonjour Zeroconf, so just search for Bonjour
Browser in Finder and look for your raspberry, our images by default has Zeroconf
enabled. Because the variety of OS's I'll only provide this guide to the following OS's:
Debian/Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Fedora/Red Hat** (not complete) , Windows 7, Windows 10.

>>> Windows7 and Windows 8,8.1 and Windows 10
        For install Bonjour in this system is quite easy, if you already have iTunes installed
    you can skip the following steps.

    Steps:
        1.  Download this tool http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999 .
        2.  Install the downloaded tool, and start the discover utilitie, to check if it is
            working.

>>> Arch Linux
        Arch Linux has a different package manager in comparise with Fedora/Red Hat, and
    Debian/Ubuntu based distributions. If you have a distribuition based on Debian/Ubuntu like
    Elementary or Linux Mint you can skyp these steps.

    Steps:
        1.  Like I've said on the introduction, Avahi is not a default component in some Linux
            and of course Arch Linux it's not a exception (hahahaha), so you need to install these
            programs to be able to use Avahi in Arch-Linux as root of course, (sudo if you have):
            $ pacman -Sy avahi nss-mdns
        2.  With the programs listed above, installed now we can start the configuration proccess
            first change the line that contains "hosts: files dns myhostname" in /etc/nsswitch.conf
            with the following content:
            hosts: files mdns [NOTFOUND=return] dns myhostname
        3.  Start the service for check if avahi-discover is working and then enable in startup
            $ systemctl restart avahi-daemon
            $ systemctl restart avahi-daemon
        4.  That's all if you don't know how to test try to ping your own computer with
            $ ping `hostname`.local
            and then try to ping you raspberry with
            $ ping raspberrypi.local
            Ps.: If you have changed Raspberry Pi hostname you need to change the raspberrypi with
                 the hostname you are using

>>> Debian/Ubuntu


>>> Fedora/Red Hat
        Fedora by default has avahi enabled, you can check if the process is active using
    'systemctl status avahi-daemon.service' (without the quotes), if avahi is not installed in your
    system by any reason, you could install with 'yum install avahi' (without the quotes).
        Don't forget to use avahi-discover to list devices with zeroconf in your network, to install
    avavhi-discover, just type 'yum install avahi-discover' in your system.
