Tutorial Raspberry Pi

Introduction:
    Raspberry Pi is a low cost embedded computer, with an ARM processor. The main
objective of the Raspberry Pi is provide a really low cost computer (only $ 35)
aimed to the development of multimedia, and teach activities. This tutorial will
explain how to install and configure Raspberry Pi with one of our packages.

Ps.: Our images are compatible with Raspberry Pi Models A, A+, B, B+ and 2 variants

Steps:
    1.  *** DOWNLOAD AND VERIFY ***
    2.  *** COPY TO THE  SDCARD ***
    3.  After you have manually installed the image on SD-CARD, it's time to turn on
        your Raspberry (yuppppeeeee!) on, so put the SD-CARD in the Raspberry slot
        and power the raspberry with the power supply (*see correct PSU for Rasp).
    4.  With the Raspberry on, now we could start the process of setup. First you have
        to choose one way of communicate with the Raspberry, and for that you have two
        options: connect to the monitor with a HDMI cable and a keyboard, or use SSH
        (Secure Shell) a linux tool for remote access.
